## Overview
This is a [Carsharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carsharing) App that I developed from scratch using Python 3 and Django with MySQL and SQLite Database Backends. It was initially developed for a real project which didn't come to fruition so I decided to keep it online as a [demo](https://carfreakclub.pythonanywhere.com) available to the public.

## Demo

You can use the full [demo here](https://carfreakclub.pythonanywhere.com), and I also made some sample code from the application publicly available in the sample_code folder, for demonstration purposes.
