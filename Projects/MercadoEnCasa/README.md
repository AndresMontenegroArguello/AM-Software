# Mercado En Casa

## Overview
This is a project I developed in 3 days for the [Starup Weekend](https://startupweekend.org) 2018 in Managua, Nicaragua, which earned the second winner spot in the competition.

It is an E-Commerce application for instant groceries delivery which I developed using various web technologies, but also validated as a profitable business model by a talented group of professionals in the fields of Finances, Marketing, Management, Design and Communication.
